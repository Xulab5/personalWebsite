            <h3>Welcome! Thanks for visiting my website</h3>
            <p>Everyone has their own unique story. Here is mine.
            I am currently a student at the Unversity of Belize(UB) pursuing an Associate Degree in Information Technology.
            The course that I found really interesting at UB was Web Development and Programming. These two course are my favorite. 
            </p> 
            <p>   
            I am someone who do not like socializing a lot. I find myself at ease in situation that do not require a lot of socializing. 
            I would rather spend time alone, or with a few people I know well, than interact with a large group. 
            I prefer small gatherings with close friends to large parties with lots of people.
            While I feel at ease in most social settings, I rarely call attention to myself.
            In settings where I meet new people, I prefer to let others take the initiative and make a connection with me.
            Watching and listening to other is more enjoyable for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am the kind of person who enjoy being methodical, conscientious, and efficient. 
                I enjoy work where I have to set a high standard for myself and for others. I take pride in my accuracy and in my ability to pay attention to the details. 
                I am not afraid of getting my hands dirty or working in areas where I can produce tangible results.
            </p>
            <p>
            I enjoy work environments that are structured, ordered and well-organized. 
            I enjoy work that allows me to deal with numbers, coding, photo editing, logo designing, data processing and record management. 
            In addition to that I enjoy the computer based aspects of most work situations and enjoy occupations that have a practical aspect to them.
            </p>
